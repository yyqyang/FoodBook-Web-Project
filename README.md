# UI
Starting with the template from the create react app, we had designed two pages for the UI. One sign in page with rount 
functions connections and another page with search bar plus table for calculation. Sign on page has been integrated into
the main page and fully developed.

ShangJun Jiang and Yuqing Yang worked together on the UI component and developed the sign-in page and implemeted some 
webpages that will be updated more in the following iteration.
